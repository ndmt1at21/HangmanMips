# HangmanMips

Simple Hangman game implemented in the MIPS architecture for the MARS emulator. The game works just like the classic game of hangman. The game starts with the program getting a random word from the dictionary. You then get to try and guess what the word is. After getting 7 wrong guesses the game is over and you lose. If you guess every character right before getting 6 wrong then you win the game.

To run it you must move the dictionary.txt file to the same directory that the mars.jar file is in.
